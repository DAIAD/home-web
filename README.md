# Introduction

The [DAIAD](http://www.daiad.eu/) project constitutes an innovative approach for addressing the challenge of efficient water management through real-time knowledge of residential water consumption.

The DAIAD project develops innovative low cost, inclusive technologies for real-time, high granularity water monitoring and knowledge extraction. Further, we devise multi-modal feedback interfaces, recommendation, and analysis services to communicate knowledge and incur behavioural changes to consumers in residential settings. DAIAD applies big data management and analysis technologies to provide efficient management and analysis of real-time water consumption data, as well as multiple relevant data sources. This enables water stakeholders to gain novel insights and explore the hidden correlations of the parameters that shape water demand strategies and water pricing, thus leading to more efficient water management.

A more thorough presentation of the goals of the DAIAD project, including its logical components, subsystems, and architecture is provided in the project’s public [deliverables](http://daiad.eu/?page_id=2426), [publications](http://daiad.eu/?page_id=2428) and [presentations](http://daiad.eu/?page_id=2430).

This repository contains the source code and documentation for the DAIAD web application and services (DAIAD@home/commons/utility following the project’s nomenclature) with the exception of select components relating to the current real-world evaluation and validation of DAIAD.
