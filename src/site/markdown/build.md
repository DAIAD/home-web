## Building

In order to build the project, [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) version 3.2+ is required.

Depending on the preferred deployment method, an executable `jar` (Java Archive) file or a `war` (Web application ARchive) file may be created. In the first case an embedded version of [Apache Tomcat](http://tomcat.apache.org/) web server in included in the `jar`. 

A `jar` file is generated by default. Creating a `war` file requires modifying the `pom.xml` file as shown bellow. The `packaging` property must be changed to `war` and the `org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-tomcat` dependency must be uncommented.

```xml
    <packaging>war</packaging>

    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-tomcat</artifactId>
        <scope>provided</scope>
    </dependency>        
```

The whole project can be built by running the following command:

    mvn clean package site

After the successful completion of the build process the following artifacts are created:

1. HTTP API documentation is stored in folder `apidoc/docs`
2. The project documentation (including this site) is stored in folder `target/site`
3. Depending on the configuration in the `pom.xml`, a project executable jar file `web-application-0.0.2-SNAPSHOT.jar` or a war file `web-application-0.0.2-SNAPSHOT.war`
